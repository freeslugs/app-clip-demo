# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Code Quality

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting and linting. Biome is a fast formatter, linter, and more for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and more.

### Available Commands

- Check for issues:
  ```bash
  npx @biomejs/biome check .
  ```

- Fix issues automatically:
  ```bash
  npx @biomejs/biome check --write .
  ```

- Format your code:
  ```bash
  npx @biomejs/biome format .
  ```

### Configuration

The Biome configuration is in `biome.json`. It includes:
- Code style rules
- TypeScript-specific rules
- React/React Native best practices
- Accessibility rules

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
